# Pokemon App

> Because building a new app for something easily searchable by Google is cool ðŸ˜Ž

This project is just a Demo that provides the possibility to search Pokemons by name or by type.
I've never used GraphQL before and now I kind of like it ðŸ”¥

To start the project just run in two different terminal tabs

```
yarn workspace @pokemon-app/server start
```
and then
```
yarn workspace @pokemon-app/client start
```
